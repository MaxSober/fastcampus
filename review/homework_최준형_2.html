        <h1>Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ review: the curvy 'iPhone 6 Plus killer'</h1>
        <p>The company’s latest phablet is a supersized version of its S6 Edge and is one of the narrowest big-screen phones going, but it has a monster price tag</p>

        <p>The Galaxy S6 Edge+ is Samsung’s latest phablet. It comes with the same curved screen edges that its little cousin, the S6 Edge, debuted as well as an eye-watering price tag.</p>
        <p>With the S6 Edge+ Samsung is really posing a simple question: is a 5.7in screen better than a 5.1in one? Almost everything else about the larger smartphone is the same as the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/01/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-smartphone-review-android">S6 Edge</a>, making the screen the big differentiator.</p>
        <h2>Big phablets</h2>

        <p>Samsung is far from new to big smartphones. It practically invented the phablet category with the first Note in 2011, and has released a series of supersized smartphones under that brand ever since. This year is no exception: the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/13/samsung-launches-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-note-5-phablets">Note 5 launched alongside the S6 Edge+</a>, but it isn’t coming to Europe immediately.</p>
        <p>Instead Samsung’s phablet of choice is just an enlarged version of its <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/01/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-smartphone-review-android">curvy S6 Edge</a>. And happily for Europeans, this is no bad thing.</p>
        <p>The screen is stunning. A 5.7in quad HD AMOLED that’s vibrant, bright and crisp. It is easily as good as the S6 Edge’s screen and one of the best available. Some will see its saturated colours as a bit garish but many will like how they’re noticeably more vibrant than the LCD displays as used in the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/20/oneplus-2-review-a-real-flagship-killer">OnePlus 2</a> or <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/17/review-iphone-6-plus-apple">iPhone 6 Plus</a>.</p>
        <p>Despite having a big 5.7in screen (phablets generally start at 5.5in), the S6 Edge+ is one of the thinnest phablets available both in depth and width. Compared to the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/01/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-smartphone-review-android">smaller S6 Edge</a> the 5.7in device is 0.1mm thinner, 5.7mm wider, 12.3mm taller and 21g heavier. Compared to Samsung’s chief rival Apple and its <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/17/review-iphone-6-plus-apple">iPhone 6 Plus</a>, which has a smaller 5.5in screen, the S6 Edge+ is somehow 3.7mm shorter, 0.2mm thinner and 19g lighter.</p>
        <p>The narrow width is aided by the curvature of the screen and makes handling it a lot easier. It’s surprising how much easier it is to wield compared to something like the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/15/samsung-galaxy-note-4-review-phablet-android-fingerprint-stylus">Note 4</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/05/google-nexus-6-review-lollipop-android-motorola-samsung">Nexus 6</a> or <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/17/review-iphone-6-plus-apple">iPhone 6 Plus</a>.</p>
        <p>The aluminium edges and glass back are the same as the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/01/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-smartphone-review-android">smaller S6 Edge</a> – they feel of premium quality and well-built, surpassing that of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/15/samsung-galaxy-note-4-review-phablet-android-fingerprint-stylus">Note 4</a> for instance. The glass back will become scratched over time, like any glass-backed smartphone.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The metal band around the phone has hard lips which makes them easier to grip, but the large phone size and curved screen makes it difficult to hold without touching the screen with your palm.</p>
        <p>This isn’t an issue for the most part as Samsung’s software is good at preventing accidental activation. Only in a particularly intense game of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.shootingstars&hl=en">Shooting Stars</a> did I notice my palm causing interference.</p>
        <p>The Galaxy S6 Edge+ is one of the most manageable phablets to date, but is still a big smartphone.</p>
