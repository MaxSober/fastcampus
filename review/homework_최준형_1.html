            <h1>‘Star Wars’ and ‘Rocky’: Separated at Birth?</h1>
            <p>Inhabiting parallel universes for close to four decades, these two film franchises have more in common than you might expect</p>
            <p><strong>By DON STEINBERG</strong><br><em>Updated Nov. 18, 2015 5:54 p.m. ET</em></p>
            <p>The seventh installments of “Rocky” and “Star Wars” debut within a month of each other, on Nov. 25 and Dec. 18. The original films premiered months apart in 1976 and ’77, and the two franchises have inhabited parallel universes for close to four decades. Together they changed Hollywood.</p>
            <p>Both were fantasies that climaxed in thrilling battles, and their success swayed studios away from the moody adult dramas of the early 1970s toward more crowd-pleasing, all-ages blockbusters.</p>
            <p>As their episodes have rolled out chronologically—as Luke used The Force and Rocky summoned the Eye of the Tiger—they’ve kept more in common than you think.</p>
